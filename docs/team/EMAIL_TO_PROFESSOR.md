# Draft email to the professor / TA

Send before the mid-semester presentation so that the changes read as agreed design decisions.

**Subject:** CS F407 project (Who Spoke What and When) — two design decisions to confirm before the mid-sem review

Dear Prof. Tirtharaj Dash,

We are Darshan Rajagoli, Vismay, Abhinav Padhi and Shrivaths Prabhu, working on the Advanced Computational Speech Engineering project. Milestones 1–3
(separation, diarization, regional & code-switched transcription) are implemented and evaluated, and
we would like to flag two decisions before the mid-semester review:

1. **Order of Milestones 1 and 2.** We implemented the proposal's order (separate the whole recording,
   then diarize) and also an alternative (diarize first, then separate only the stretches where people
   overlap). On the same 72 test conversations the alternative lowers the who-said-what word error rate
   (cpWER) from 55.8 % to 49.5 % and the diarization error rate from 26.2 % to 20.3 %, and the separator itself
   works about twice as well when it only has to handle the overlaps (+9.6 dB vs +4.5 dB SI-SDR). We will present
   both and recommend the second, unless you would prefer we keep the original order as the main pipeline.

2. **Datasets.** We use IndicVoices and Project Vaani. Nirantar is only distributed as a single ~200 GB
   archive, from which the Hindi portion cannot be extracted separately, and we could not find a public
   source for AIR-RS-DB. Since real broadcasts have no ground-truth labels, we score the pipeline on
   conversations assembled from real IndicVoices speech with real background noise, which gives exact
   labels for every stage.

The LLM post-processing stage (Milestone 4) is planned for after the review. Please let us know if you
would like either decision changed.

Thank you,
Darshan Rajagoli, on behalf of the team
